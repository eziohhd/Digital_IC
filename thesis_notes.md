## Dissecting Convolutional Neural Networks for Efﬁcient Implementation on Constrained Platforms

### LeNet

The LeNet architecture is comprised of a convolutional layer
with six 5 × 5 ﬁlters and a max-pooling layer with stride 2, followed by another convolutional layer with sixteen 5 × 5 Filters and a max-pooling layer with stride 2. Three fully connected layers follow, with sigmoid activation for the ﬁrst two and softmax for the last.

Fig. 2 shows the top-level architecture and memory hierarchy of the Eyeriss system. Eyeriss has two clock domains: the core clock domain for processing, and the link clock domain for communication with the off-chip DRAM through a 64-b bidirectional data bus. The two domains run independently and communicate through an asynchronous FIFO interface.
